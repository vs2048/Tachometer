# Tachometer
A tachometer that uses a line following sensor.

This is a simple tachometer that uses a SparkFun line sensor to count the time between revolutions on a shaft. Tape a black line onto a shaft and aim the sensor at it and this library will calculate the rotational velocity of the shaft. Measured speed is written to a 16x2 segment LCD or the tach library can be used independantly.

Use the following sensor or similar:
